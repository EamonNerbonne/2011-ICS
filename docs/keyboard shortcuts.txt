e print energy estimate (particle system only)
+ speed up simulation
- slow down simulation
* include simulation accuracy by using more iterations
/ decrease simulation accuracy by using fewer iterations
1,2,3 reinitialize rotation and rotate around one of the primary axes
7 use particle based sim
8 use orientation based sim
9 use quaternion based sim
n toggle normalization
d toggle damping (particles only)
